      I designed, developed and brought to market [Radio Belgium](https://radiobelgium.be), a native app to turn any iOS or Android device instantly into an amazing radio player.  

      Since launch, the app has been downloaded over 500 000 times with more than __150 000 monthly active users__ and frequently tops the App Store charts. The app was also featured on popular press sites, such as De Standaard and Humo.

      Besides being an interesting project to sharpen my technical skills, it also allowed me to gain __hands-on experience__ in a variety of non-technical fields such as product management, business development and marketing

      Inspired by the succes of Angry Birds and Cut The Rope, I developed and released my own __physics-based puzzle game__ during high school.

      Tapaway was my first foray into iOS development and made use of the [Cocos2d](https://cocos2d-x.org) game engine, which I integrated with the [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) physic engine.
      This combination allowed me too learn the ropes of __programming and memory management in Objective-C(++)__.

      The end result was an enjoyable game with over 30 handcrafted levels and received great reviews from numerous players.
      Since this was mainly a learning project, I stopped supporting it when iOS transitioned to 64-bit.
      A small demo of the game is still available on YouTube.

  - id: thesis
    name: Master's thesis on Deep Learning
    description: |
      After completing courses on __artificial intelligence and machine learning__, I was excited about the huge potential of these technologies.
      I was especially intrigued by deep learning and thus decided to do my master's thesis in this domain.

      Specifically, the title of my master's thesis is __automatic comic colorization and restoration through deep learning__.
      Briefly worded, the goal is to fully automatically colorize degraded black-and-white pages from old comics.
      To do so, I'm building upon the powerful [pix2pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/) architecture that proposes __conditional adversarial networks__ as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems.

      Completing this thesis, allowed me to immerse myself into recent deep learning research.
      I also gained a lot of hands-on experience with applying __state-of-the-art deep learning techniques__ to solve challenging problems.

    name: Path Tracer in Rust
    description: |
      After completing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and really liking the programming experience and safety guarantees of the language, I set out to complete a larger project to further __improve my Rust-skills__.

      Writing a path tracer is a great way to become more acquainted with a language, since it touches upon so __many different common aspects of a language__.
      Besides, it is very cool to watch your own program making a scene come alive.

      I'm still working on some key features and plan on publishing the __full source code on GitHub__ in the near future.
